# PONG GAME

Game developed with object-oriented Javascript.

This game is nothing more than Atari's classic 1972 game made for browsers. It is made for two players in local using the keyboard.

## Getting Started
The game starts, player 1 will use the W and S keys to move his cursor, player 2 will use the I and K keys to move his cursor and thus avoid losing the game.
When one of the two players reaches 5 points the game will end, so do not let them crush you!
